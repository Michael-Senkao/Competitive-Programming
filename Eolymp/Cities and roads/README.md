The first line contains the number <code>n</code> <code>(0≤n≤100)</code>. Each of the next <code>n</code> lines contains <code>n</code> numbers, each of which is <code>one</code> or <code>zero</code>. 
Moreover, if the position <code>(i,j)</code> of square matrix is <code>one</code>, then the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> and <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> city are <strong>connected</strong> by road, and if <code>zero</code>, 
it is <strong>not connected</strong>.
